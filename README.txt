# Joomla + Gantry Task

This project was created as part of a technical task based on the sample site [kuyasilver.com](https://kuyasilver.com/).

## Requirements
- Build a homepage using Joomla and Gantry (without hardcoding into Gantry).
- Create a **Management** page using *Category Blog*.
- Create a **News** page using *Category List* with the latest 3 press releases displayed.

## Implementation
1. Installed Joomla and Gantry 5 framework.
2. Created content categories for **News** and **Management**.
3. Configured menu items:
   - **Homepage**: Custom Gantry layout.
   - **Management**: Category Blog layout.
   - **News**: Category List layout with 3 latest items shown.
4. Styled the pages with SCSS, following the sample siteâ€™s structure.
5. Ensured no hardcoded content was added directly into Gantry particles.

## Notes
- This was my first time building a site with Joomla and Gantry.
- Through this task, I gained a practical understanding of how to structure pages and use Gantry effectively.
